**Diabetes Prediction**
Overview:
The Diabetes Prediction project aims to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on various health-related features. Using a dataset of medical records, the model classifies individuals as either having diabetes (1) or not having diabetes (0). The dataset contains various features like glucose level, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and other relevant information.
This project uses machine learning algorithms to train a classifier that predicts diabetes based on the input features.
Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 8 features (medical and demographic information) and a binary target variable (Outcome).
Features:
Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies the person has had.
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test.
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg).
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
Insulin: Serum insulin levels (mu U/ml).
BMI: Body Mass Index (BMI) based on weight and height.
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function, a measure of family history of diabetes.
Age: Age of the individual (years).
Outcome: Target variable (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-diabetic).
Project Goals:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for model training.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and analyze the dataset to understand the relationships between the features and the target variable.
Modeling: Train various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) to predict diabetes.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models' performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
